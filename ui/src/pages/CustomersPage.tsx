    color: "text-yellow-400",
    bg: "bg-yellow-500/10",
    border: "border-yellow-500/20",
    scenario: "Validating a SaaS idea before building",
    challenge: "A solo founder needed a professional landing page to validate a new project management tool before investing in development. No developer on the team, no budget for an agency.",
    solution: "Used Titan Builder to generate a full responsive landing page — hero, feature grid, pricing table, FAQ, and waitlist form — from a single detailed prompt.",
    outcome: "Landing page live in under an hour. Waitlist signups collected within days. Validation data used to make a go/no-go decision before writing a single line of product code.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Time to launch", value: "< 1 hour" }, { label: "Setup cost", value: "$0" }, { label: "Decision", value: "Data-driven" }],
  },
  {
    type: "Agency",
    icon: Building2,
    color: "text-blue-400",
    bg: "bg-blue-500/10",
    border: "border-blue-500/20",
    scenario: "Scaling client delivery without hiring",
    challenge: "A small digital agency was spending 3–5 days per client website build. Margins were thin and turnaround times were causing client friction.",
    solution: "Integrated Titan Builder into their delivery workflow. Designers brief Titan with client requirements; Titan generates the initial build; the team refines and ships.",
    outcome: "Build time reduced significantly. Agency able to take on more clients per month without additional headcount. Faster delivery improves client satisfaction.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Workflow", value: "Streamlined" }, { label: "Capacity", value: "Increased" }, { label: "Headcount", value: "Unchanged" }],
  },
  {
    type: "Developer",

    color: "text-green-400",
    bg: "bg-green-500/10",
    border: "border-green-500/20",
    scenario: "Unblocking a backlogged internal tool",
    challenge: "A senior developer needed to build an internal reporting dashboard urgently. The backlog was weeks deep and the dashboard was blocking a key client deliverable.",
    solution: "Used Titan Builder to generate the full dashboard — data tables, filters, chart components, CSV export, and role-based access — in a single session.",
    outcome: "Dashboard delivered in days instead of weeks. Developer used the saved time to ship other backlog items in the same sprint.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Delivery", value: "Days not weeks" }, { label: "Backlog cleared", value: "Multiple items" }, { label: "Quality", value: "Production-ready" }],

    bg: "bg-purple-500/10",
    border: "border-purple-500/20",
    scenario: "Automating red team reconnaissance and reporting",
    challenge: "A penetration testing firm was spending 2-3 days per engagement manually mapping attack surfaces, cataloguing CVEs, and writing executive risk reports. Each report was inconsistent and time-consuming to produce.",
    solution: "Deployed Titan Cyber tier — Argus for automated OSINT and subdomain enumeration, Astra for vulnerability scanning and CVE cross-reference against NVD and ExploitDB, and Titan Builder to generate structured executive reports from raw scan output.",
    outcome: "Full attack surface analysis, CVE report, and executive summary reduced from 3 days to under 4 hours per engagement. Consistent, client-ready format. Time saved reinvested into deeper manual testing and red team operations.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Report time", value: "< 4 hours" }, { label: "Coverage", value: "Automated" }, { label: "Consistency", value: "100%" }],

    scenario: "Building an MVP under time pressure",
    challenge: "A startup needed a working MVP to demo to investors within days. Their developer was unavailable and they couldn't afford to delay the pitch.",
    solution: "Used Titan Builder to generate a full React MVP — course listing page, student dashboard, progress tracker, and admin panel — across multiple Builder sessions.",
    outcome: "MVP ready on schedule. Used as the foundation for the production codebase after the demo.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Timeline", value: "Met" }, { label: "Sessions", value: "Multiple" }, { label: "Foundation", value: "Production-ready" }],

    scenario: "Eliminating shadow AI across a team",
    challenge: "A growing company had team members using various AI tools without oversight. Uncontrolled AI usage was creating data leakage risk and inconsistent outputs.",
    solution: "Deployed Titan Enterprise across the team. Centralised AI usage under one platform with audit logs, role-based access, shared vault, and usage dashboards.",
    outcome: "Shadow AI usage eliminated. All AI activity logged and auditable. Team productivity improved with standardised workflows.",
    metrics: [{ label: "Shadow AI", value: "Eliminated" }, { label: "Visibility", value: "Full audit log" }, { label: "Governance", value: "Centralised" }],
